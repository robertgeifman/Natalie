## Synopsis
Natalie generates Swift code based on storyboard files to make work with Storyboards and segues easier. Generated file **reduce usage of Strings** as identifiers for Segues or Storyboards.

Proof of concept implementation to address the String issue for strongly typed Swift language. Natalie is a Swift command-line application (written in Swift) that produces a single `.swift` file with a bunch of extensions to project classes along the generated Storyboard enum.

Natalie is written in Swift and requires Swift to run. The project uses [SWXMLHash](https://github.com/drmohundro/SWXMLHash) as a dependency to parse XML and due to framework limitations. Based on commit: 2211b35c2e0e8b08493f86ba52b26e530cabb751

### Enumerate Storyboards
Generated enum Storyboards with a convenient interface (drop-in replacement for UIStoryboard).

```swift
struct Storyboards {
    struct Main {...}
    struct Second {...}
    ...
```

Instantiate initial view controller for storyboard
```swift
let vc = Storyboards.Main.instantiateInitialViewController()
```

Instantiate ScreenTwoViewController in storyboard, using storyboard id
```swift
let vc = Storyboards.Main.instantiateScreenTwoViewController()
```

example usage for prepareForSegue()

```swift
override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
  if segue == MainViewController.Segue.ScreenOneSegue {    
    let viewController = segue.destinationViewController as? MyViewController
    viewController?.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellowColor()
  }
}
```

...it could be `switch { }` statement, but [it's broken](https://twitter.com/krzyzanowskim/status/611686899732869121).

### Segues

Perform segue
```swift
self.perform(segue: MainViewController.Segue.ScreenOneSegue, sender: nil)
```

Each custom view controller is extended with this code and provide a list of available segues and additional information from Storyboard.

`Segue` enumeration contains list of available segues

`kind` property represent types Segue

`destination` property return type of destination view controller.

```swift
extension MainViewController {

    enum Segue: String, Printable, SegueProtocol {
        case ScreenOneSegueButton = "Screen One Segue Button"
        case ScreenOneSegue = "ScreenOneSegue"

        var kind: SegueKind? {
            ...
        }

        var destination: UIViewController.Type? {
            switch (self) {
            case ScreenOneSegueButton:
                return ScreenOneViewController.self
            case ScreenOneSegue:
                return ScreenOneViewController.self
            default:
                assertionFailure("Unknown destination")
                return nil
            }
        }

        var identifier: String { return self.description }
        var description: String { return self.rawValue }
    }
}
```

### Reusable Views To Improve Performance

Collections and tables views use `reuseidentifier` on cell to recycle a view.

If you define it, their custom view controllers will be extended with a `Reusable` enumeration, which contains list of available reusable identifiers

example to dequeue a view with `Reusable` enumeration with `UITableView`:
```swift
func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(ScreenTwoViewController.Reusable.MyCell, forIndexPath: indexPath) as! UITableViewCell
    cell.textLabel?.text = "\(indexPath.row)"
    return cell
}
```

Before dequeuing your view, you must register a class or a xib for each identifier.
If your cell view has custom class defined in storyboard, in your controller you can call directly
```swift
override func viewDidLoad()  {
    tableView.registerReusableCell(MainViewController.Reusable.MyCell)
}
```
You can pass the view instead - the view must define the `reuseidentifier`
```swift
    tableView.registerReusableCell(tableViewCell)
```

If your reusable custom view, you can also execute code according to reusable values
```swift
class MyCustomTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {
    override func prepareForReuse() {
        if self == MyCustomTableViewController.Reusable.MyCell {
            ...
        }
        else if self == MyCustomTableViewController.Reusable.mySecondCellId {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Colors (iOS 11, macOS 10.13)

Generate an `UIColor` (or `NSColor`) static property for each asset colors used in your storyboard.

## Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

```
$ git clone https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie.git
$ cd Natalie
$ ./scripts/build.sh
$ Binary at path ./Natalie/natalie
```

if you want easy Xcode integration you may want to install the binary to be easily accessible for any application from `/usr/local/bin`

```
$ cp natalie /usr/local/bin
```

#### Homebrew

```
$ brew install natalie
```

You can also put `natalie` executable file at the root of your project folder and keep it under version control. This way everyone even your CI will be able to generate the files.


### Xcode Integration

Natalie can be integrated with Xcode in such a way that the `Storyboards.swift` the file will be updated with every build of the project, so you don't have to do it manually every time.

This is my setup created with **New Run Script Phase** on **Build Phase** Xcode target setting. It is important to move this phase above Compilation phase because this file is expected to be up to date for the rest of the application.

- Select the project in the Project Navigator on the left of your Xcode window
- Select your App Target in the list
- Go in the "Build Phases" tab
- Click on the "+" button on the upper left corner and choose "New Run Script Phase" and copy/paste script:

```sh
# Adjust path to "natalie" binary
# NATALIE_PATH="$PROJECT_DIR/natalie"
NATALIE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/natalie"

if [ -f $NATALIE_PATH ]; then
    echo "Natalie Generator: Determining if generated Swift file is up-to-date."
    
    BASE_PATH="$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME"
    OUTPUT_PATH="$BASE_PATH/Storyboards.swift"

    if [ ! -e "$OUTPUT_PATH" ] || [ -n "$(find "$BASE_PATH" -type f -name "*.storyboard" -newer "$OUTPUT_PATH" -print -quit)" ]; then
        echo "Natalie Generator: Generated Swift is out-of-date; re-generating..."

        /usr/bin/chflags nouchg "$OUTPUT_PATH"
        "$NATALIE_PATH" "$BASE_PATH" > "$OUTPUT_PATH"
        /usr/bin/chflags uchg "$OUTPUT_PATH"

        echo "Natalie Generator: Done."
    else
        echo "Natalie Generator: Generated Swift is up-to-date; skipping re-generation."
    fi
else 
    echo "error: Could not find Natalie Generator at $NATALIE_PATH; Please visit https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie for installation instructions."
    exit 1
fi
```

- add `Storyboards.swift` to the project.

## Usage:

Download Natalie from Github: https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie and use it in the console, for example like this:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie.git
$ cd Natalie
```

The command expects one of two types of parameters:

* path to a single .storyboard file
* path to a folder

If the parameter is a Storyboard file, then this file will be used. If a path to a folder is provided Natalie will generate code for every storyboard found inside.

```
$ natalie NatalieExample/NatalieExample/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard > NatalieExample/NatalieExample/Storyboards.swift
```
